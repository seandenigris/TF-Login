I format the edit account component content using an HTML table. I am an example of how to customize the edit account component rendering.

To use your own form, subclass TFEditAccountComponentBase, implement #renderFormContentFor:On: using me as a guide, and use your edit account component in place of TLEditAccountComponent.
